1) Given two arrays 𝚊[] and 𝚋[], each containing n distinct 2D points in the plane,
design a subquadratic algorithm to count the number of points that are contained
both in array 𝚊[] and array 𝚋[].

Load the elements on a map of booleans to false.
Run the second array changing the existent to true. filter them by flag in true

Hint: shellsort (or any other subquadratic sort).

2) Permutation. Given two integer arrays of size n, design a subquadratic algorithm to determine whether one is a
permutation of the other. That is, do they contain exactly the same entries but, possibly, in a different order.

Hint: Sort both
